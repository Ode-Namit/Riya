                <p>The eyes of wise, easy to be indulge in for endless time,<br>
                The sight devoid of slight—sorrowfulness of specs, a loss of its prime.<br>
                The pleasing voice of one as violin performing perfect rhyme,<br>
                One as me could be engulfed in one’s words eternally; if ethics permitted eternity.<br>
                The thread of silks, the divinity resting upon one’s shoulders—elevating their dignity,<br>
                A cozy crown to be worn, one forth glance at it, forges allure, an affinity.<br>
                The presence as a pure pristine yet felt to be a pulchritudinous fur,<br>
                A blush on face, cheeks resonate rosette nebulae enough to expunge any’s shudder.<br>
                The essence of one is such ethereal, even use of muse the elucidation can’t be under,<br>
                A fairy’s fellows are the one that can illuminate it by their behaviour—<br>
                The flowers’ blooming by one bask in, muddled bees assumed one as birth of nectar.<br><br>
                “Might my ink sledge spread over, albeit one couldn’t be define;<br>
                Even if I ends with time—tremendously tries, my words still couldn’t endorse one’s adore—desire refine.”</p>

                <p>Most beauty I seek, blossom you say,<br>
                Yet I found her—gorgeous to my eyes forth for days.<br>
                She might deny, how pictorial priceless she owns,<br>
                A mythical, mindful beauty, which she is to be unknown.<br><br>
                She may not know where I get to see,<br>
                How pulchritudinous she stood, as I glanced at her glow or it founded me.<br>
                Easy to grasp—isn’t it? If you linger in the lawn,<br>
                And hoping none observe your apricity—devoid of night, a delightful dawn.<br><br>
                I get jealous, for being a filthy human,<br>
                It’d be better if I were a mirror, then my destiny would also be done.<br>
                As I’d be able to show, what you throw,<br>
                Compliments aren’t to be dumped; they exist to let you know—<br>
                About how spectacular, stunningly stupendous is your flow!</p>

                And my answer could seem as a lie.<br>
                Albeit of my words—to bequeath one,<br>
                Cannot grasp elucidate even a bit, none.<br>
                If I here to forth to enroll the word,<br>
                One is a shine so noble even a star is absurd.<br>
                A peaceful nature of one, can guard an obscure,<br>
                Enlightens the constellation of anyone’s shudder, a heart so soft as fur.<br>
                Nebulae is the one that could stand beside,<br>
                As both of them are bestowing light, a cute cosmic ride.<br>
                Beauty of one cannot be defined; as it requires ink of divine,<br>
                And I here forth is none greater than the virtue of mine.</p>
